1. The three ways of building layouts
   Layout is basically the way that text, images and all the other content is placed and arranged on the webpage. 
   Layout gives the page a visual structure, and then into that structure we can place the content.
   Building a layout means to arrange page elements into some kind of visual structure instead of simply having all of our elements, so all of our content, basically placed one after another.

   So, layout exists for a reason because it makes our sites easier to understand and also makes it visually more pleasing.

   Two types of layouts
   Page Layout Vs. Component Layout
   Page layout is laying out the elements, so the big pieces of content inside of a webpage or a website. On the other hand, these bigger page layouts are themselves made up of components. And the components themselves need to have some kind of layout because these components themselves are made out of smaller pieces of content, which also needs to be arranged in some kind of way. And so we can say that components themselves also have a layout.

   Three ways of building layouts
   i. Float layouts - basically the old way of building layouts using the float css property. Now, these types of layouts are quickly getting replaced by newer technologies such as FlexBox and CSS Grid.
   ii. FlexBox - FlexBox is one of the modern ways of laying out elements. And in the case of FlexBox, it is perfect for building one-dimensional layouts. So, basically a layout which is just a row and all without using floats. So, FlexBox might be perfect for simpler component layouts.
   iii. CSS Grid - The other modern way of laying out elements. So with CSS Grid, we can actually build complete two dimensional layouts which is perfect for big page layouts and also more complex components.
