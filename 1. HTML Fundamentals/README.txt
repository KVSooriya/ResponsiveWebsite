1. Why do we use so called doctype in html <!DOCTYPE html> ?
   This lets the browser know that we are actually using HTML in the file and all browsers will then know that they should use the HTML 5 
   specification to render this html.

2. Each and every page should only have one H1 heading (ie. only one primary heading). This is not really mandatory, but a good practise

3. Attributes - piece of data that describes the element

4. Why alt attribute in img tag is useful <img src="" alt=""/> ?
   Alt is an alternative text that should describe what the image is about. This is important for various reasons. One of them is that it will
   allow search engines such as Google Chrome to actually know what is in the image. Second by specifying description of the image, we can allow blind people to use a website. ie. users who use a screen reader will not see the image but instead they will have the screen reader read the alternative text.

5. What are semantic HTML mean and why it is important ?
   Elements actually have a meaning or a purpose attached to them. It is important for multiple reasons. One of them is Search Engine 
   Optimization which basically means that search engines, such as Google will be able to understand the structure of our content and therefore, they will be better able to analyze what our content and what our webpage is all about. And semantic HTML is extremely important for accessibility, and especially for people who rely on screen readers to consume our webpages.
  
   Note: When we think about HTML, we should not only think about how it actually looks like in the browser but even more what these elements 
   actually mean and what they stand for.
