1. The 7 Steps to a Great Website
   
   i.   Define
   ii.  Plan
   iii. Sketch
   iv.  Design and Build
   v.   Test and Optimize
   vi.  Launch
   vii. Maintain and Update

   First, we need to define and to plan the project. Then we start thinking about the layout of the page and create some initial sketches. And only then after these three phases, we can finally start designing and building the website. Then once that is done, we need to, test and optimize that page before we can actually launch it. But even then, we are not done. Because any website that is live on the web needs to be maintained and updated.

   i. Define the Project
   The first step is to simply define who the website is actually for. For eg, is it for ourself, or is it for a client of our freelancing business or maybe even the agency that we work in? 
   
   Then after, we define what the website is actually for. So, basically we need to decide whats the main goal or the main purpose of the site? Is it to provide information or to sell some product, or is it simply to entertain the user? And by the way, these three purposes, so providing information, selling something or entertaining are the three most common goals of websites. ie. This step is about defining our business goals and user goals. So, this can be something very simple and very quick.
   Eg: A company that produces premium dog food. So, when this company sets out to create a new website, then
   Business Goal: Selling premium dog food
   User Goal: Finding high-quality dog food for good price

   Define a target audience. And here, try to be really specific if we can and if it makes sense for our particular project. And many times, actually this comes from our client. But usually when the client is smaller, they dont have this well defined and in that case, we should totally do this part.
   From the above example,
   target-audience: Women, 20 to 40 years old, living in Europe, earning over 2000$/month, with a passion for dogs.

   The whole point of defining the project is, we need to design our project with all the goals and the target audience in mind. The reason for that is the better we know who we built the website for and what we want to achieve with it, the more success our project will have in the end.

   ii. Plan the Project
   This planning, should of course, be based on the business goals, user goals and the target audience that we defined in the previous step.
   
   Planning the project means to finally start thinking about our website and so that starts with actually planning and gathering the content of the website. ie. text, images, videos etc.,
   Usually the content should be provided by client, but we can also help them build, so to produce, and to find content for them. If we have smaller client, then they usually dont have the content yet. In that case, we will have to write it ourselves or even hire some other copywriter. We dont have to do this for free for our client, we should charge a little bit extra in this case. Of course, if its only about finding images, that is okay because that is very easy and fast, but writing content is something entirely different.
   
   Then if we have a bigger website, then it is also time to plan the sitemap, so basically planning what pages the site needs and how they relate to one another based on all the content that we now have.

   Also, based on the content, here we can also start planning the sections that each of the page should have in order to convey the message to the user as good as possible.

   Note: The reason for emphasizing the content is, it is the content who should guide the project and the design of the website in the end. ie. Always have the content actually guide the project and the design, and do not do the opposite. Dont come up with a pretty design and a pretty website and then in the end, fill it with the content. That is definitely the wrong way to go.

   Then finally once we know about company, project and all of our content, it is now time to also define the website personality that we will want to implement in our design.

   iii. Sketch Layout and Component ideas
   Here, we will start thinking about the components and maybe some layout patterns that we're gonna need in order to convey the message of our content.

   Once we have an idea about what components and what layouts we might want to use, its time to create some sketches with pen and paper or maybe even with some design software like Figma. And these sketches at this point should be very, very simple. So very low fidelity without any details.

   This is really an iterative process: experiment with different components and layouts until we arrive at a first good solution.

   We dont need to spend lot of time in order to sketch everything, so our entire design at this point. And of course, also dont make it perfect. In some situations, we just need to sketch like half of our design, and then we're already ready to jump into HTML and CSS.

   What matters most is that we dont just start designing in code without having a general or a rough idea of what we actually want to build

   iv. Design and Build Website
   Use decisions, content and sketches from step 1 to 3 to design and build the website with HTML and CSS ("designing in the browser")

   Create the design based on selected website personality, the design guidelines and inspiration

   Use the clients branding (if it exists already) for design decisions whenever possible like colors, typography, icons etc.,

   v. Test and Optimize
   Once we're done building the project, we need to test and we need to optimize it before we can actually launch it to the web and call it ready. 

   Ensure that the website actually works well in all the major browsers, so in Google Chrome, in Firefox, Safari and Microsoft Edge. Hopefully we will not have to test for the old IE because then most of the things will actually not work.

   In order to test the responsive design, we need to actually test the website on actual mobile devices and not just in our developer tools.

   We also need to optimize all our images that we use in our website. And that means two things: First, we need to actually give them the right dimensions in pixels. And second, we need to compress them in order to not force our users to download huge images because that is very bad UX.

   Also, we need to fix some simple accessibility problems, so things like issues with the color contrast

   Another common thing that we usually do is to run a performance test in our Google Chrome developer tools, which is called LightHouse and try to fix the reported issue. (end of the course) 

   Think about Search Engine Optimizations (SEO)

   vi. Launch the MasterPiece
   Once all the work is done, everything is perfect, and got approval from the client, its time to share our masterpiece with the world!
   Its time to launch the website to the internet.

   In technical terms, what that means is to upload our website to a hosting platform. Now there are countless options here but we will use Netlify. Netlify has a very nice free plan and it is a perfect choice.

   However, uploading the website to a hosting platform is not the end of the story. We actually also need to buy a great domain name for our project because otherwise users will have no way of finding our website. And when it comes to choosing a great domain name, go with one that is memorable for users and that is easy to write and importantly, one that of course represents the company or the brand that the website is for.

   vii. Maintain and keep updating website
   Launching the website is not the end.
   Keep the website content updated over time. If we are working with a client, we can create a monthly maintenance contract (recurring revenue). Many web developers actually do this.

   We also need to install some kind of analytics software (eg. Google Analytics or Fathom). And reason why it is important is that it gives us stats about our website users, which we can then use in the future to adapt our site structure and the content and really to do all other kinds of fine-tuning of our website. It really makes the website better and better over time. 

   And finally, one aspect of many websites that needs to be kept up to date is a blog. And a blog is a great way to keep users coming back to our website, and it is also very good for search engine optimizations if we use it with the right content. So, if there is a blog, then of course, that needs to be updated regularly because otherwise it doesnt make sense to have a blog in the first place.
